#### Workflow

1) For our paired work, Emma and I worked in tandem based on the given instructions by the teacher.
Emma and I shared thoughts and problem solved through a slight mistake we made by not creating a
`.js file` and coding in a `.md file`. Once we sorted this issue out we continued on with the directions. As for our workflow, we worked line by line together until time elapsed and we needed to rejoin the main group. We finished approximately 50% of the work in the given time.
